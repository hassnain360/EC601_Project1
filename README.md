## Photogrammetry: From 3-D Objects to Point Clouds

### Introduction

Photogrammetry refers to obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the world around us in a compuational form. Many varients exist, depending on the use case. It combienes the fields of optics, projective geometry, software engineering, etc. One form of photogrammetry is '3-D' modelling, where it refers to making 3-D models of objects, typicalling using simple 2-D images obtained from cameras. Other varients exist, for example using high speed cameras flying on drones, sometimes called Ariel photogrammetry. Another form is terrestial photogrammetry, where the cameras are fixed. This can be a camera trying to measure the speed of cars on the road. 


### Problem Statement

Obtaining digital representations of the physical world is an important computational challenge. The aim is to obtain digital representations as close to the reality as possible. This can include the dimensions, surface, texture, area, and other qualities of the subject. Naturally, constraints exist, over the hardware used to capture information from the world, as well as the software technqiues available to render the data to the required format as per the required use case.

Though digital representations have been constructed using various mixtures of specialized hardware, software and domain experts, the need for futher sophistication has not abated. In this project, I survey the field of photogrammetry, provide some examples of exitant and old technologies, and review the research going on in the field.

### Some Applications 

Photogrammetry has vast applications in the fields of medicine, engineering, mapping, architecture, manufacturing, police investigation, cultural heritage, structural geology, real estate, film & entertainment, land surverying, etc. 
A common use is creating maps out of aerial photos, proven to be  accurate and cost-effective. Photogrammetry is being used in startups using the these maps to use AI to obtain information about the world, for example population densities, deforestation, etc. Photogrammetry has a cardinal advantage over a similar technology, LIDAR, that it is very cost effective, since it only requires images. 


A very common use is creation of maps using aerial photogrammetry . Google maps has an enormous use-base, and is an important use-case of photogrammetry.  To create such maps, the camera is mounted in an aircraft and is pointed vertically towards the ground. en As the aircraft flies, multiple images of the ground are taken. The aircraft traditionally have been fixed wing manned craft but many projects now are done with drones and UAVs. Traditionally these photos were processed in a stereo-plotter (an instrument that lets an operator see two photos at once in a stereo view) but now are often processed by automated desktop systems. This is an example of evolution and necessity of photogrammetry in making real world accessible to us in our digital devices. 

### Open Source Research

Due to its ubiquity, there is a blooming open source community on photogrammetry. Softwares like AliceVision, All3dp, Meshroom, Colmap, Micmap are used for various photogrammetry purposes. 


Other products with commerical support for General Applications include `Context Capture & Acute 3D`, `PhotoModeler` ,  `PhotoScan`,  `Pix4dMapper` , `Reality Capture`, `Recapn addition`. `DataMapper` &  `DroneDeploy` are  more specifically aimed at just UAV / drone photograhy and are cloud based.     

Other power aerial photogrammetry mapping platforms include `BAE Systems SOCETSET` , `DAT/EM International Summit Evolution `, `Intergraph Z/I Imaging`, `KLT Associates ATLAS`,  `PCI Geomatics`.
